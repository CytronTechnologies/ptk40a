PTK40A is designed by Cytron Technologies (www.cytron.com.my). It is designed as a training kit for 8-bit 40-pin PIC Microcontroller. The kit comes with PIC16F877A (as the time I write this), yet it is compatible with 5V, 40-pin, 8-bit PIC such as PIC16887, PIC16F19XX, PIC18F4520, PIC18F4550, etc. The kit have quite comprehensive of tools on it. We include the USB programmer which is compatible with PICkit2 for loading program easier. There are two 7segment display, 2x16 character LCD, Relay, DC motor with simple rotary encoder, stepper motor, RC Servo, 40-pin ZIF socket for PIC, changeable Crystal, one reset button, 3 programmable button, ADC with LM35 temperature sensor or potentiometer, I2C with DS1307, SPI with external EEPROM, USB for PIC18F4550, UART, and many more :)
